Starting a Polymer 3.0 project with yarn example:
-------------------------------------------------
> mkdir sdl-srch-bar
> yarn init
# Answer the prompts to set up your project (in most cases accept the defaults)

# Note:  Leave "flat": true     out of the package.json file and add --flat flag when adding front-end components.   Example below:

> yarn add --flat @polymer/polymer@next

# For an existing project with a package.json file, this approach is probably less disruptive.

# This has the advantage of keeping all dependencies in a single node_modules folder, but means that you need to remember the --flat flag every time you add a component.
